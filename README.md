ZUber-2D-Engine
===============

This is the game engine for the games I will be making. You can use this engine, you do not need to give credit. Just don't tell people you made it.

This engine will contain an easy-to-use API, and have the easiest commands possible. I am going to try to make it as close to the English language possible.

Email me for questions, help, or feedback. I have a few months off of school because of surgery, so I will most likely answer quickly! Thanks for your support.

There will be a website when I have enough money to make one. Please give me motivation! Thank you all!
